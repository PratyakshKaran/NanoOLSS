# NanoOLSS (Nanometreic Oscillatory Loading on Soft Sample): 

Simulates the oscillatory loading of a rigid sphere on a thin soft sample coated on a rigid substrate, wherein, the separation between the coating and the sphere can reach a separation of a few nanometers around the time in oscillation where the sphere is closest to the substrate.
